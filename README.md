# Axisium
I am a Mathematics and Computer Science Enthusiast. My coding journey began with scratch at the age of 10, but now I write code in a few programming languages! 
> Like water, I ebb and flow.

# Experience
My experience with programming languages and tools in descending order. Sorry Scratch Team, but I don't think `scratch` really counts...
- **Node** *best language*
- **Vue** *best framework*
- **Python**
- **Figma** *best design tool*
- **C#**

# Packages
I will make some `npm` packages in the future.
